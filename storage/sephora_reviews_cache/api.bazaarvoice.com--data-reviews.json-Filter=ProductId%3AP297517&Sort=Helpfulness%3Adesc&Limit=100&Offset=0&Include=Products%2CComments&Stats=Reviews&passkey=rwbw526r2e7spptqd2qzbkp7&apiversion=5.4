I have dry/combination skin. I don't have bad acne, but I get a couple of annoying, stubborn pimples that all pop up here and there on my face from stress, pms, and just because they want to make my life more difficult. So just like you, I was looking through the reviews trying to decide if this stuff really works like the majority (despite a few poor reviews) say it does. I quickly relieved it, and I decided to go ahead and try it out. And let me just say, I AM SUPER IMPRESSED. I have legitimately left this stuff on my stubborn spots for a few hours, and every single pimple is almost completely gone! They'll be vanished by morning at this rate! I've tried masks and scrubs and face washes, but nothing seems to help-EXCEPT THIS. I am not an easily impressed person, and I am always looking for something better, even when I like a product, but I am sticking with this right off the bat. Where has this been all my life?! The bottle is pretty small, but that's probably because they're selling miracle juice in a bottle. It's very easy to squeeze out without wasting any product, and you literally only need to put a tiny dot directly on your problem spots, so this is going to last quite a long time.

It is extremely drying. I can't use this every day, otherwise I end up with little, flaky spots on my face. The bottle is also teeny tiny and I don't know think I'm quite getting my money's worth.

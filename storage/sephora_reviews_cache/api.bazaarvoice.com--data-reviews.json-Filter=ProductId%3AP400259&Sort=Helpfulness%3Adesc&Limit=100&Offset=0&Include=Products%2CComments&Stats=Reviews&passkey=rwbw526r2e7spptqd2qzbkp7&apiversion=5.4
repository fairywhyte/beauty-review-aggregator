There's more goodness in there, but don't want to repeat the whole ingredients label. It's a superior product. It feels nice on. And, they've just reformulated the packaging (it's now even better).\n\nThen, not only is the product great, but this is a clearly customer-oriented company. I had an issue with one of their products, emailed them directly, and the issue was resolved soon after. This is the kind of thing that makes me happy to support a company.

I was so happy lol... anywho, I received the trial sizes cuz they were finally in stock & I hate that I DO love this product so much cuz now I have to spend the full price on it. My skin is brighter, my acne scars from my high school days have lightened as well. At first, my skin became red around my cheek and forehead area.

Together these have given me the best skin of my life. This serum plays best with their Umbra sunscreen (tinted moisturizers/bb creams tended to pill up or leave my skin parched) and the trick I learned from an interview with their founder is to mix a pea size amount of Umbra with a pump of the C-firma. It makes the umbra more liquid and easier to spread across your face, like frosting (don't rub it in).

I mean holy grail good. Seriously. What makes this product so unique compared to other vitamin C's on the market is the packaging. Very rarely do you see a company use airtight pumps that are travel friendly (added bonus!) AND house their treatments in completely light-proof packaging. Since Vitamin C is extremely unstable and can oxidize very quickly if exposed to light & air, the best way to preserve it is the way they have. Note: an indication that a vitamin C product has gone bad is by its color notably changing from clear to a murky orange color.

Obviously I can't comment on any long-term effects, but I trust the company and I read several expert reviews on it saying it was well-formulated and effective. I like that vitamin C remains effective up to 3 days after using the serum, because it is not practical for me to use this every day for a couple reasons. It causes a mild burning/tingling when I use it, and it is worse if I've used an AHA product or my Clarisonic before using it. Also, if I don't wait long enough after using it (15-20 min) to put on my sunscreen, my skin will start tingling again. Since I have to wait before putting anything on my skin after it, I like that it's moisturizing enough that my skin doesn't feel dry during that time.

So I find that this c-serum, in conjunction with my prescription acne-scar medication, really does the trick in imparting a more even and radiant skin tone.

It was uneven, with some dark spots and dull.  A far cry from what it used to look like.  I started using some pricey skin care for older skin, but nothing seemed to help.  Plus, all of it was too heavy for my skin which is still a bit oily.  I got whiteheads, blackheads and my face felt greasy.  I switched to Drunk Elephant because none of the other products had AHAs, glycolic acids or anything to encourage exfoliation.  I started using the Day Serum and Night Serum about 3 weeks ago.  I've noticed some positive changes in my skin.  Particularly a smoother texture and a brighter tone.  And I'm not an oil slick any longer.  However, I'm giving the Day Serum 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons.  First, it does have a slightly funky, but subtle scent.  Once you put your moisturizer on over it, the scent isn't noticeable.  Second, the pump can behave slightly jumpy.  Sometimes it won't dispense smoothly and the serum will spray onto your clothes.  If you don't wash it off immediately, it can leave a light stain or bleached spot.","ContextDataValues":{"skinType":{"Value":"combination","Id":"skinType","ValueLabel":"Combination","DimensionLabel":"Skin Type"},"beautyInsider":{"Value":"yesvib","Id":"beautyInsider","ValueLabel":"Yes - I'm a VIB ","DimensionLabel":"Beauty Insider"},"StaffContext":{"Value":"false","Id":"StaffContext","ValueLabel":"No","DimensionLabel":"I am a Sephora employee"},"IncentivizedReview":{"Value":"false","Id":"IncentivizedReview","ValueLabel":"False","DimensionLabel":"I received this product as a free sample"},"age":{"Value":"over54","Id":"age","ValueLabel":"over 54","DimensionLabel":"Age"}},"ProductId":"P400259","Videos":[],"CommentIds":[],"Photos":[],"TotalNegativeFeedbackCount":0,"RatingRange":5,"CampaignId":"US_SEPHORA_EMAIL","UserLocation":"Port Hueneme, CA","SecondaryRatingsOrder":[],"TotalCommentCount":0,"ContextDataValuesOrder":["skinType","age","beautyInsider","IncentivizedReview","StaffContext"],"TagDimensionsOrder":["Pro"],"ClientResponses":[],"TotalPositiveFeedbackCount":13,"IsRatingsOnly":false,"LastModificationTime":"2016-06-14T05:00:04.000+00:00","Pros":null,"ProductRecommendationIds":[],"BadgesOrder":["yesvib"],"AuthorId":"1457154102","Helpfulness":1.0,"SubmissionTime":"2016-06-14T04:45:56.000+00:00","AdditionalFields":{},"Title":"Change of pace for my face","TotalFeedbackCount":13,"AdditionalFieldsOrder":[],"ModerationStatus":"APPROVED","IsFeatured":false,"Cons":null,"TagDimensions":{"Pro":{"Label":"Pros","Values":["exfoliating"],"Id":"Pro"}},"SecondaryRatings":{},"Badges":{"yesvib":{"ContentType":"REVIEW","Id":"yesvib","BadgeType":"Custom"}},"SubmissionId":"abkaj5dadacdqpoonbu7eepyq","IsSyndicated":false,"IsRecommended":null,"LastModeratedTime":"2016-06-14T05:00:04.000+00:00","Id":"68037898","ContentLocale":"en_US"},{"UserNickname":"Marisy311","Rating":5,"ReviewText":"oh my gosh!

Other products I have used sort of clump or ball up when applying moisturizer on top, and I do not have that problem with this serum.  I get a super oily T-zone during the day, and after 2 weeks of using this it has actually improved. Worth every penny!

The company customer service is exceptional with direct expansive communication on why the previous pump system didn't work tho the formula was exceptional and the info on the new delivery system with tweaks to the formula so it will remain as effective, gentle while actually not spraying everywhere. Minimal odor non sticky and layers beautifully with both my heavier physical sunscreen of Josie Maran, their lighter sunscreen, and both my Skinceuticals mineral sunscreens. No pilling when I layer all my other daytime items such as Korean snail essence, regular toners, Kate Sommerville Goats milk, etc. I've tried multiple lotions potions and no problem with stickiness or balling up. You can't beat the formula with no added fragrance or irritating fragrant plant oils The company truly is committed to using high quality products non harmful ingredients that are well researched. All Natural doesn't mean safe or effective and Drink Elephant had found a great balance of how skincare should be formulated.

I used this serum on my face, neck, hands, and chest at least five days a week.\n\nI am 19 years old, with awful acne scarring. I still suffer from breakouts, though the acne scarring is my main issue. I've also had fine lines since I was 14, because I was an avid swimmer who did not wear sunscreen.\n\nFrom the beginning, I noticed that my pores were less clogged and my skin was brighter. As for long term use, I did not see a significant improvement in my acne scars until very recently. The acne scarring on my cheeks and chest have faded significantly, but they are still there.\n\nI have not noticed any improvement in my fine lines after using this product, expect perhaps in my neck area.\n\nThe sun spots on my hands have faded slightly.\n\nOverall, I expected more of an improvement in the fading of my acne scars and sun spots than I received. This product is expensive, but I hope that I can continue purchasing a Vitamin C serum for the remainder of my life, for the antioxidant protection and Vitamin C's ability to fade skin discolorations. I may repurchase this product for skin maintaince, but I plan on purchasing a 20-25 percent Vitamin C serum first, since I still have so many skin discolorations to fade.\n\nI would also like to note that it took my skin a few weeks to adjust to this serum. My skin use to become irritated upon application of this serum. I actually ran into a strange problem of the vitamin c serum tinting my skin red at the beginning...But as soon as I wiped my skin, the red color would come off. This serum also feels uncomfortably sticky until sunscreen is layered on top. I also don't recommend relying on this serum for moisture, my skin became very oily compensating for a lack of moisture until I layered a moisturizer/moisturizing sunscreen on top of this serum.","ContextDataValues":{"StaffContext":{"Value":"false","Id":"StaffContext","ValueLabel":"No","DimensionLabel":"I am a Sephora employee"},"IncentivizedReview":{"Value":"false","Id":"IncentivizedReview","ValueLabel":"False","DimensionLabel":"I received this product as a free sample"}},"ProductId":"P400259","Videos":[],"CommentIds":[],"Photos":[],"TotalNegativeFeedbackCount":0,"RatingRange":5,"CampaignId":null,"UserLocation":null,"SecondaryRatingsOrder":[],"TotalCommentCount":0,"ContextDataValuesOrder":["IncentivizedReview","StaffContext"],"ClientResponses":[],"TagDimensionsOrder":[],"TotalPositiveFeedbackCount":6,"IsRatingsOnly":false,"LastModificationTime":"2016-03-28T17:00:09.000+00:00","Pros":null,"ProductRecommendationIds":[],"BadgesOrder":[],"AuthorId":"5127570957","Helpfulness":1.0,"SubmissionTime":"2016-03-28T16:52:05.000+00:00","AdditionalFields":{},"Title":"Results at the end!","TotalFeedbackCount":6,"AdditionalFieldsOrder":[],"ModerationStatus":"APPROVED","IsFeatured":false,"Cons":null,"TagDimensions":{},"SecondaryRatings":{},"Badges":{},"SubmissionId":"sh0jo0ytaa6ozheaip7kxp1kn","IsSyndicated":false,"IsRecommended":null,"LastModeratedTime":"2016-03-28T17:00:09.000+00:00","Id":"62992107","ContentLocale":"en_US"},{"UserNickname":"lsharlocke","Rating":5,"ReviewText":"First of all this is in the perfect pump that keeps the light out so the vitamin C doesn't break down.

Product layers very well.","ContextDataValues":{"skinType":{"Value":"combination","Id":"skinType","ValueLabel":"Combination","DimensionLabel":"Skin Type"},"beautyInsider":{"Value":"yesvib","Id":"beautyInsider","ValueLabel":"Yes - I'm a VIB ","DimensionLabel":"Beauty Insider"},"StaffContext":{"Value":"false","Id":"StaffContext","ValueLabel":"No","DimensionLabel":"I am a Sephora employee"},"IncentivizedReview":{"Value":"true","Id":"IncentivizedReview","ValueLabel":"True","DimensionLabel":"I received this product as a free sample"},"age":{"Value":"25to34","Id":"age","ValueLabel":"25-34","DimensionLabel":"Age"}},"ProductId":"P400259","Videos":[],"CommentIds":[],"Photos":[],"TotalNegativeFeedbackCount":0,"RatingRange":5,"CampaignId":"BV_RATING_SUMMARY","UserLocation":"Rural NC","SecondaryRatingsOrder":[],"TotalCommentCount":0,"ContextDataValuesOrder":["skinType","age","beautyInsider","IncentivizedReview","StaffContext"],"TagDimensionsOrder":["Pro"],"ClientResponses":[],"TotalPositiveFeedbackCount":1,"IsRatingsOnly":false,"LastModificationTime":"2016-08-28T17:30:04.000+00:00","Pros":null,"ProductRecommendationIds":[],"BadgesOrder":["yesvib","IncentivizedReviewBadge"],"AuthorId":"8185482333","Helpfulness":1.0,"SubmissionTime":"2016-08-28T17:15:09.000+00:00","AdditionalFields":{},"Title":"Layering serum","TotalFeedbackCount":1,"AdditionalFieldsOrder":[],"ModerationStatus":"APPROVED","IsFeatured":false,"Cons":null,"TagDimensions":{"Pro":{"Label":"Pros","Values":["moisturizing","layers well","absorbs quickly"],"Id":"Pro"}},"SecondaryRatings":{},"Badges":{"IncentivizedReviewBadge":{"ContentType":"REVIEW","Id":"IncentivizedReviewBadge","BadgeType":"Custom"},"yesvib":{"ContentType":"REVIEW","Id":"yesvib","BadgeType":"Custom"}},"SubmissionId":"5sl0f3lz5q47hyohk37azu7v2","IsSyndicated":false,"IsRecommended":null,"LastModeratedTime":"2016-08-28T17:30:04.000+00:00","Id":"72579059","ContentLocale":"en_US"},{"UserNickname":"Karenhl","Rating":5,"ReviewText":"I have been using this serum for almost a year, I can see my skin transformation!  my skin has improve tone and also fills more firm.  if absolves very fast and doesn't leave an oil residue.","ContextDataValues":{"skinType":{"Value":"combination","Id":"skinType","ValueLabel":"Combination","DimensionLabel":"Skin Type"},"beautyInsider":{"Value":"yes","Id":"beautyInsider","ValueLabel":"Yes - I'm a Beauty Insider","DimensionLabel":"Beauty Insider"},"StaffContext":{"Value":"false","Id":"StaffContext","ValueLabel":"No","DimensionLabel":"I am a Sephora employee"},"IncentivizedReview":{"Value":"false","Id":"IncentivizedReview","ValueLabel":"False","DimensionLabel":"I received this product as a free sample"},"age":{"Value":"45to54","Id":"age","ValueLabel":"45-54","DimensionLabel":"Age"}},"ProductId":"P400259","Videos":[],"CommentIds":[],"Photos":[],"TotalNegativeFeedbackCount":0,"RatingRange":5,"CampaignId":"BV_RATING_SUMMARY","UserLocation":null,"SecondaryRatingsOrder":[],"TotalCommentCount":0,"ContextDataValuesOrder":["skinType","age","beautyInsider","IncentivizedReview","StaffContext"],"ClientResponses":[],"TagDimensionsOrder":[],"TotalPositiveFeedbackCount":3,"IsRatingsOnly":false,"LastModificationTime":"2017-03-12T19:45:05.000+00:00","Pros":null,"ProductRecommendationIds":[],"BadgesOrder":["beautyInsider"],"AuthorId":"10057611028","Helpfulness":1.0,"SubmissionTime":"2017-03-12T19:39:18.000+00:00","AdditionalFields":{},"Title":"Love love Love C Firma","TotalFeedbackCount":3,"AdditionalFieldsOrder":[],"ModerationStatus":"APPROVED","IsFeatured":false,"Cons":null,"TagDimensions":{},"SecondaryRatings":{},"Badges":{"beautyInsider":{"ContentType":"REVIEW","Id":"beautyInsider","BadgeType":"Custom"}},"SubmissionId":"5y0qpqb6qikeqlhs8h18f5xdp","IsSyndicated":false,"IsRecommended":null,"LastModeratedTime":"2017-03-12T19:45:05.000+00:00","Id":"84638878","ContentLocale":"en_US"},{"UserNickname":"Adriana1206","Rating":5,"ReviewText":"I went to Sephora, i bought a gift for my friend and i got this serum as a sample, Oh was i happy when i used it ?

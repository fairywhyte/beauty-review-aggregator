I love using it after I wash my face at night along with the argan oil. The directions say to use this first, but I like to use the oil first then the serum. It helps spread the serum better so that I have to use less. My favorite thing to do before bed after I wash my face is do my favorite face masks and then apply the argan oil and argan milk serum and let my skin soak it in overnight. The next morning my skin is totally glowing and looks so hydrated.\nBut now that I have raved I must say what I don't like. I do not like this under my makeup. No matter how little I use it makes my skin get oily fast and my makeup does not last as long. I prefer bobbie brown's vitamin enriched face base for under my makeup.

I cannot wear makeup unless my skin is completely moisturized otherwise it will be in dry patches- that is how dry my skin is...I have been using the Josie Maran Argan Oil line (cleansing and face oil) for the past 3 years and my skin has never been better. I usually stick to the same products, but about a week ago ago right after I purchased my usual cleansing oil and face oil, I decided to try the argan milk sample at Sephora. I used the dropper and I put it on my face. I didn't want to buy it right away because I wanted to see how my skin would feel hours later- also I had just bought my usual products and figured I would wait until it was running low before I splurged on this. So I decided not to wait until I ran low because I wanted this right away. I went back and bought this yesterday. I put it on last night after showering and before bed and my skin was super soft and smooth when I woke up- even more so than the oil which I always loved. I put some more on this morning before work and here we are mid day and my skin is still as soft as it was when I put it on this morning.

As a beauty blogger, I buy a lot of different products to test and review. This product was really hyped up. The brand is known as an \"Instagram\" brand or one that gains its popularity and notoriety primarily by relying on IG / YouTube influencers to push their products. I actually liked the Rose Gold Elixer when I tried it, but I learned a very valuable lesson after trying this one. This product has been shoved down our throats by every major influencer, none of whom actually perform actual product testing and give their unbiased results, It has been advertised primarily as a \"Primer\" and later as a skincare treatment. It really is none of those things. \r\n\r\nI ordered this during the recent VIB sale.  I usually don't review a skincare product until I've used it at least 4-6 weeks. No skincare product can deliver miraculous results after a few uses (hint, hint to all the people bragging how this worked miracles after trying a sample). However, I couldn't keep using it that long and stopped after 2 days to return it, \r\n\r\nPlease read the ingredients. This is filled with fillers and ingredients that are proven to cause skin irritation and sensitivity. It's filled with multiple red dyes (the worst) and strong fragrance. I usually like a subtle fragrance, but the fragrance in this is overwhelming and doesn't disappear as you're wearing it. I could literally smell it several hours after putting it on my face. That kind of fragrance in skincare can be harmful and irritating to the skin. It also leads to further collagen breakdown which increases the rate of wrinkles and signs of aging. It contains very little beneficial ingredients to justify the price. It literally feels like water.

You'll pay an unfortunate price if you continue to use this product. All the fillers, dyes, fragrance etc. are going to sensitize your skin. Every time you go out in the sun, it'll be like you are cooking your face. \n\nI wish the people who gave this glowing reviews would read up on these horrible ingredients and the consequences of using a product like this. I don't understand why Sephora took on this brand. \n\nI'm also disappointed with all the beauty gurus that promoted this product. I don't care if you're sponsored if you really believe in a product. YouTube is sometimes someone's job & primary source of income. With that said, you lose all credibility when you're pushing a product like this. It may be your job, but try to keep your integrity.

The next day I immediately used it as a primer as it says to- I was a greaseball 30 mins after putting my makeup on. The foundation around my nose was literally melting off. :( Nothing changed in my routine. So I tried mixing it in with my foundation, wearing it as the first step of my skin care routine before my make up, or just a few TINY dots... but every which way I tried just makes everything melt off my face and I don't even have oily skin. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know. For now, I'm using this as a part of my night time skin care serum. I really wanted to love this stuff because everyone is raving about it...but it just doesn't seem to work for me. I love the packaging, the color and just the whole unicorn trend thing going on, but the product itself did not blow me away. I would recommend getting a sample and testing it throughout the day before purchasing.

I don't like how critical reviews get a ton of \"unhelpful\" marks by others. I feel like people don't want to hear anything other than \"omg this is a holy grail product, changed my life\" because they want that for themselves but come on laidies! We have to be smarter and look out for each other so in that spirit here's my warning about this product, I was super excited to order this. I use retinol at night which dries out my face so I was looking for a nice hydrating serum that would also provide some antioxidant benefits. This serum seemed to fit all those things. I just used it and I'm so dissapointed to learn that it's got sparkly glitter in it, very sparkly glitter, silver color. I looked at my face after applying and I could see the glitter sitting on top of my skin. I don't know if it goes away or stays shimmery but this is a huge turn off for me. Why would you put glitter in a serum? Serums are supposed to penetrate deep in the skin, I don't want glitter in my serum! I just feel like it gives the product a cheap feeling, that along with the pink color and smell makes me feel like I'm putting something synthetic on my face which is the exact opposite of what I was looking for (vitamins, antioxidants, fresh, etc). I just thought someone should mention this because had I known this was glittery pink and smelled like lipstick I would not have purchased. Maybe you won't mind this of you're using as a makeup primer and are into glitter and sparkly highlighter but if you're not looking for that I don't think you'll like this.","ContextDataValues":{"beautyInsider":{"Value":"yesvibr","Id":"beautyInsider","ValueLabel":"Yes - I'm a VIB Rouge ","DimensionLabel":"Beauty Insider"},"StaffContext":{"Value":"false","Id":"StaffContext","ValueLabel":"No","DimensionLabel":"I am a Sephora employee"},"IncentivizedReview":{"Value":"false","Id":"IncentivizedReview","ValueLabel":"False","DimensionLabel":"I received this product as a free sample"},"age":{"Value":"25to34","Id":"age","ValueLabel":"25-34","DimensionLabel":"Age"}},"ProductId":"P417141","Videos":[],"CommentIds":[],"Photos":[],"TotalNegativeFeedbackCount":4,"RatingRange":5,"CampaignId":"BV_RATING_SUMMARY","UserLocation":"Chicago, IL","SecondaryRatingsOrder":[],"TotalCommentCount":0,"ContextDataValuesOrder":["age","beautyInsider","IncentivizedReview","StaffContext"],"ClientResponses":[],"TagDimensionsOrder":[],"TotalPositiveFeedbackCount":62,"IsRatingsOnly":false,"LastModificationTime":"2017-03-10T04:30:03.000+00:00","Pros":null,"ProductRecommendationIds":[],"BadgesOrder":["yesvibr"],"AuthorId":"1935241341","Helpfulness":0.939394,"SubmissionTime":"2017-03-10T04:26:40.000+00:00","AdditionalFields":{},"Title":"Why didn't anyone warn me? : (","TotalFeedbackCount":66,"AdditionalFieldsOrder":[],"ModerationStatus":"APPROVED","IsFeatured":false,"Cons":null,"TagDimensions":{},"SecondaryRatings":{},"Badges":{"yesvibr":{"ContentType":"REVIEW","Id":"yesvibr","BadgeType":"Custom"}},"SubmissionId":"9ibdwn7hvlfikw92ns4cy4j01","IsSyndicated":false,"IsRecommended":null,"LastModeratedTime":"2017-03-10T04:30:03.000+00:00","Id":"84353003","ContentLocale":"en_US"},{"UserNickname":"abbyshrey","Rating":5,"ReviewText":"When I bought this I was very confused about what the actual product does.

I tried applying it a few different ways (with hands, with a blender, before moisturizer,  after moisturizer). My problematic dry spots didn't look smooth at all, I think it actually enhanced the dryness by making my foundation slightly cake more in these areas. I've gotten far smoother results with other primers for sure. But my makeup did technically stay in place all day and held up well otherwise.

I've tried different face oils like Argan oil, Rose Hip oil etc. and they all leave my skin super greasy and/or don't do much. So I got a sample of it and immediately fell in love with it on first use.. and now I own the full size bottle! It's totally worth the hype. First off it's soooo pretty! It's pink and shimmery, but strangely enough the glitter doesn't show on your face. Which is great because unless I'm going to a party or something, I don't want to have a face full of glitter. It also smells AMAZING. This stuff absorbs super quickly too, so your face isn't left feeling greasy or sticky at all. I use this in conjunction with my \"Renewed Hope In a Jar\" face cream by Philosophy, and then apply my primer and foundation. My nose is incredibly oily so I thought that this might not be good to use on my nose at all, BUT my nose also tends to get dry around my nose ring, and also around the outter edges. I've found that this helps with my nose immensely! It doesn't make it shiny or greasy, AND it soothes the dry patches that a normal moisturizer just won't!

The first breakout wasn't that bad, and it was also my time of the month, so I contributed it to that. However, four more hard pimples formed under the skin on my forehead and another in between my eyebrows. This was weird, because I haven't broken out between my eyebrows in years, and the only reason I used to was because in lab class I had to wear goggles and they were dirty. I've never had a breakout this bad all at once. After checking the reviews about a week after receiving my product, all I saw were mentions of how it broke other people out as well. Mind you, when I first checked the reviews, there was no mention of breakouts. I feel like Farsali may have changed their formula to keep up with the demand of now being available on Sephora's website.

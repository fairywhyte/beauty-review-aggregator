She raved about it so it seemed worth a shot. I was using another Vitamin C serum that seemed to be burning my skin and I was looking for a gentler alternative. This booster is now my best friend. Within minutes of mixing it with my favorite moisturizer my skin seemed to come alive. It just seems to add a radiance and resilience to your skin. I have very sensitive skin and most things will break me out. I have not experienced any irritation, burning, redness, or breakouts from using this product. It seems to make everything I add to my face better. It really is a buster. As an added side effect when added to my primer I find that my makeup actually stays on all day. This is a huge plus as I have VERY oily skin and of the hundreds of products I have tried not one of them has been able to achieve this.\nThe only downside is that sometime I find it will make my glycolic serum peel to much. I do not suggest using glycol and the powder at the same time. Be mindful that you only need a \"tiny\" bit per usage of this product. Using to much at once may cause irritation as this is a concentrated formula.","ContextDataValues":{"skinType":{"Value":"oily","Id":"skinType","ValueLabel":"Oily","DimensionLabel":"Skin Type"},"beautyInsider":{"Value":"yes","Id":"beautyInsider","ValueLabel":"Yes - I'm a Beauty Insider","DimensionLabel":"Beauty Insider"},"age":{"Value":"25to34","Id":"age","ValueLabel":"25-34","DimensionLabel":"Age"}},"ProductId":"P204606","Videos":[],"CommentIds":[],"Photos":[],"TotalNegativeFeedbackCount":0,"RatingRange":5,"CampaignId":"BV_RATING_SUMMARY","UserLocation":null,"SecondaryRatingsOrder":[],"TotalCommentCount":0,"ContextDataValuesOrder":["skinType","age","beautyInsider"],"TagDimensionsOrder":["Pro"],"ClientResponses":[],"TotalPositiveFeedbackCount":4,"IsRatingsOnly":false,"LastModificationTime":"2013-03-05T15:15:57.000+00:00","Pros":null,"ProductRecommendationIds":[],"BadgesOrder":["beautyInsider"],"AuthorId":"1469760327","Helpfulness":1.0,"SubmissionTime":"2013-03-05T15:06:44.000+00:00","AdditionalFields":{},"Title":"Your Skin Will Thank You","TotalFeedbackCount":4,"AdditionalFieldsOrder":[],"ModerationStatus":"APPROVED","IsFeatured":false,"Cons":null,"TagDimensions":{"Pro":{"Label":"Pros","Values":["invigorating","brightening"],"Id":"Pro"}},"SecondaryRatings":{},"Badges":{"beautyInsider":{"ContentType":"REVIEW","Id":"beautyInsider","BadgeType":"Custom"}},"SubmissionId":"duyd0t875ul30vczlywp1z4q0","IsSyndicated":false,"IsRecommended":null,"LastModeratedTime":"2013-03-05T15:15:57.000+00:00","Id":"27763232","ContentLocale":"en_US"},{"UserNickname":"Verb","Rating":5,"ReviewText":"It's doing an excellent job of lightening my hyperpigmentation.

It is a great value too, I have been using it for about 2 months now and it is still 90% full.","ContextDataValues":{"skinType":{"Value":"combination","Id":"skinType","ValueLabel":"Combination","DimensionLabel":"Skin Type"},"beautyInsider":{"Value":"yes","Id":"beautyInsider","ValueLabel":"Yes - I'm a Beauty Insider","DimensionLabel":"Beauty Insider"},"skinTone":{"Value":"light","Id":"skinTone","ValueLabel":"Light","DimensionLabel":"Skin Tone"},"age":{"Value":"18to24","Id":"age","ValueLabel":"18-24","DimensionLabel":"Age"}},"ProductId":"P204606","Videos":[],"CommentIds":[],"Photos":[],"TotalNegativeFeedbackCount":0,"RatingRange":5,"CampaignId":"BV_RATING_SUMMARY","UserLocation":null,"SecondaryRatingsOrder":[],"TotalCommentCount":0,"ContextDataValuesOrder":["skinType","skinTone","beautyInsider","age"],"TagDimensionsOrder":["Pro"],"ClientResponses":[],"TotalPositiveFeedbackCount":4,"IsRatingsOnly":false,"LastModificationTime":"2012-02-10T23:30:05.000+00:00","Pros":null,"ProductRecommendationIds":[],"BadgesOrder":["beautyInsider"],"AuthorId":"2730800207","Helpfulness":1.0,"SubmissionTime":"2012-02-10T23:19:04.000+00:00","AdditionalFields":{},"TotalFeedbackCount":4,"AdditionalFieldsOrder":[],"Title":null,"ModerationStatus":"APPROVED","IsFeatured":false,"Cons":null,"TagDimensions":{"Pro":{"Label":"Pros","Values":["preventative"],"Id":"Pro"}},"SecondaryRatings":{},"Badges":{"beautyInsider":{"ContentType":"REVIEW","Id":"beautyInsider","BadgeType":"Custom"}},"SubmissionId":"evyc3gf8m1owco1rjcmodfcp3","IsSyndicated":false,"IsRecommended":null,"LastModeratedTime":"2012-02-10T23:30:05.000+00:00","Id":"21931638","ContentLocale":"en_US"},{"UserNickname":"weaselberries","Rating":5,"ReviewText":"I love this stuff! I've tried vitamin C serums that are WAY more expensive than this, and this blows them all out of the water.\n\nPros:\nIt's not sticky like other C products (unless you're really packing it on, three scoops at a time) and it lasts forever, which is a huge bonus if you're a germophobe like me and won't use anything that's more than a year old. I'm kind of forgetful so I don't always use this regularly - which is why I notice the results when I do. My skin is brighter, my skin tone is more even, and the redness and freckling I get when I go out in the sun without sunscreen fade and disappear within days. The best part is its versatility - I've mixed this into at least 4 different moisturizers, and it works beautifully with all of them.\n\nCons:\nJust one - like any powder, it tends to compress at the bottom of the bottle, and you end up scooping out enough for two or three applications. This can be solved pretty easily by stirring with a toothpick, though.\n\nOverall, this is a great product, VERY affordable, and worth three times the cost.","ContextDataValues":{"skinType":{"Value":"dry","Id":"skinType","ValueLabel":"Dry","DimensionLabel":"Skin Type"},"beautyInsider":{"Value":"yes","Id":"beautyInsider","ValueLabel":"Yes - I'm a Beauty Insider","DimensionLabel":"Beauty Insider"},"skinTone":{"Value":"light","Id":"skinTone","ValueLabel":"Light","DimensionLabel":"Skin Tone"},"age":{"Value":"25to34","Id":"age","ValueLabel":"25-34","DimensionLabel":"Age"}},"ProductId":"P204606","Videos":[],"CommentIds":[],"Photos":[],"TotalNegativeFeedbackCount":0,"RatingRange":5,"CampaignId":"SEPHONLINEPPE","UserLocation":"Oakdale, MN","SecondaryRatingsOrder":[],"TotalCommentCount":0,"ContextDataValuesOrder":["skinType","skinTone","beautyInsider","age"],"TagDimensionsOrder":["Pro"],"ClientResponses":[],"TotalPositiveFeedbackCount":3,"IsRatingsOnly":false,"LastModificationTime":"2010-08-20T00:15:03.000+00:00","Pros":null,"ProductRecommendationIds":[],"BadgesOrder":["beautyInsider"],"AuthorId":"1412570994","Helpfulness":1.0,"SubmissionTime":"2010-08-20T00:03:40.000+00:00","AdditionalFields":{},"Title":"Great!","TotalFeedbackCount":3,"AdditionalFieldsOrder":[],"ModerationStatus":"APPROVED","IsFeatured":false,"Cons":null,"TagDimensions":{"Pro":{"Label":"Pros","Values":["dimishes fine lines","preventative","healing"],"Id":"Pro"}},"SecondaryRatings":{},"Badges":{"beautyInsider":{"ContentType":"REVIEW","Id":"beautyInsider","BadgeType":"Custom"}},"IsSyndicated":false,"SubmissionId":null,"IsRecommended":null,"LastModeratedTime":"2010-08-20T00:15:03.000+00:00","Id":"15025640","ContentLocale":"en_US"},{"UserNickname":"facepaintgirl","Rating":5,"ReviewText":"I've used this off and on for years.

I have been using this a total of 2+ months (so around 8 weeks) diligently every morning and night. I also use a half a scoop each use. Instead of mixing this into my moisturizer in the morning, I mix it into my sunscreen (Neutrogena) which works awesome. At night I mix the Booster Powder into my serum (Korres Wild Rose Serum) and apply it to my face and than apply my anti-bac lotion than moisturizer/cream.\n\nThe results I have seen from this powder was almost immediate. The first week I used this I could, honestly, tell a huge difference in my skin. Not only did it help give my skin this glow about it but it also helped with some acne that had flared up (it helped diminish the size and the redness of the blemishes). For some reason the first couple weeks a lot of products work wonders and than all of a sudden they just seem to stop working and I don't/wont see any results after the initial first few weeks (even though I continue to use the products). With this Booster Powder I CONTINUED to see glowing skin, reduced redness, little to no new blemishes, no irritation and HELP with my scarring.\n\nNow for the reason I bought this: I bought this for one reason and one reason only... TO HELP WITH DISCOLORATION DUE TO ACNE SCARRING. You are not going to see immediate results, you have to wait for them with this product. BUT the results I DO see are amazing. I had a horrible scar from a cyst (cystic acne) that I had when I was 16. It has always been red around that area and hasn't lightened up over the years I have had it. Since using this powder it is almost non existent, seriously. You can barely tell that the scar is even there. My skin tone is practically even now, which is saying a lot since I HAD a lot of discoloration. Sure you can still see some of my acne scarring but they have lightened up dramatically. I guarantee with continued use I will see even more results.\n\nAs for fine lines and such... I really do not have any fine lines/wrinkles to begin with BUT I personally find this product to make my face feel \"tight\" not the tight feeling you get after you wash your face and your face is left dehydrated. I mean tight like your face is getting firm. Also, I think this is an awesome preventative. I mean seriously this product is SO easy to use. Plus I find it would be beneficial for any age to use this and boost their favorite moisturizer, sunscreen, serum with some Vitamin C.\n\nThis is an awesome product that really delivers results (if your patient). I am a total believer in this product and will continue purchasing it after my little bottle runs out. So easy to use and the results are fantastic.","ContextDataValues":{"skinType":{"Value":"oily","Id":"skinType","ValueLabel":"Oily","DimensionLabel":"Skin Type"},"beautyInsider":{"Value":"yes","Id":"beautyInsider","ValueLabel":"Yes - I'm a Beauty Insider","DimensionLabel":"Beauty Insider"},"skinTone":{"Value":"fair","Id":"skinTone","ValueLabel":"Fair","DimensionLabel":"Skin Tone"},"age":{"Value":"18to24","Id":"age","ValueLabel":"18-24","DimensionLabel":"Age"}},"ProductId":"P204606","Videos":[],"CommentIds":[],"Photos":[],"TotalNegativeFeedbackCount":0,"RatingRange":5,"CampaignId":"BV_RATING_SUMMARY","UserLocation":"Orange County, CA","SecondaryRatingsOrder":[],"TotalCommentCount":0,"ContextDataValuesOrder":["skinType","skinTone","beautyInsider","age"],"TagDimensionsOrder":["Pro"],"ClientResponses":[],"TotalPositiveFeedbackCount":19,"IsRatingsOnly":false,"LastModificationTime":"2011-03-11T20:00:06.000+00:00","Pros":null,"ProductRecommendationIds":[],"BadgesOrder":["beautyInsider"],"AuthorId":"1552189306","Helpfulness":1.0,"SubmissionTime":"2011-03-10T17:06:25.000+00:00","AdditionalFields":{},"Title":"WOW.

If I ever go a day without using it, it shows. It evens out my skin tone and has helped fade some red marks from old zits.\n\nThe one con I have with this product, which is not enough to deduct a star, is the smell it leaves on my face and hands.

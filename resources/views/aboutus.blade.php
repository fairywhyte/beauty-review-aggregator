            <p>
                "Itâ€™s very difficult to find a beauty product that suits you and your skin. Sometimes you just end up with whatever is recommended
                by the sales person. In order to find the right skincare product you have to test various ones based on your
                findings. Rather than relying on the sales person who might be biased in recommending you a certain product,
                we think the knowledge of all the women who have tried and tested skincare products is much more helpful to decide
                which product is right for our skin. Therefore we decided to come up with La Ravelle, a beauty review aggregator
                that sums up the number of ratings across various beauty websites, and gives back these aggregated numbers. In
                this way, we help women cut the decision time to buy her next favourite skincare item."
